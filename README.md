# Predicting-Heart-Disease-Using-Machine-Learning
This notebook looks into using various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting weather or not someone has heart disease based on thier medical attributes

we're going to take the following approcah :

*Problem definition
*Data
